# IoT

IoT stands for Internet of Things, i.e. "smart" and "connected" devices. Usually this boils
down to having an app which connects to a server in China which allows you control a
device (i.e. coffe machine, wall socket, radio, light, ...) which connects to a server in China
too. This repository contains code which runs at my home to make it "smart" and "connected"
without connecting to China.
